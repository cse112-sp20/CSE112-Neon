## Release
  This is done through Gitub Actions. To do so ensure
  that you are making a Pull Request from branch dev
  into master. On top of that you will need to make
  sure that you follow the following steps.
  
    1. Update the version in your project's package.json file (e.g. 1.2.3)
    2. Commit that change (git commit -am v1.2.3)
    3. Tag your commit (git tag v1.2.3). Make sure your tag name's format is
    v*.*.*. Your workflow will use this tag to detect when to create a release.
    4. Push your changes to GitHub (git push && git push --tags)
    
  After the build check under the release tab in Github.
